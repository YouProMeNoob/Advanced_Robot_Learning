This is the repository of Group 2 in the Summer 2025 Advanced Methods of Robot Learning course.
All files relevant for an assignment are in the respective folder. Refer to the respective assigment's submission PDF on what the corresponding files are used for or what they showcase.

There are two branches, **final_sim** and **original_sim**:  
- The branch **final_sim** contains the updated simulation, which was used for the final working demonstrations.  
- The branch **original_sim** contains the simulation in an older configuration, which is retained for legacy use and also contains the direct robot movement control solution.
